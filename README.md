### Hello there 👋

I'm Kyle, a software dev with a musical mind for positive impact. My background involves philosophy, audio engineering, entrepreneurship, and most recently, education at Turing School of Software and Design. 

- 🔭 I’m working on graduating from the Front End program, and am in Mod 3. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Cypress, Mocha, and Chai fundamentals you can shake a stick at. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I'm an open book and love to chop it up.
